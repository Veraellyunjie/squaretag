=head1 NAME

squaretag - tag files by using filenames

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  squaretag [-s SEP] add    [-v] [-n] [-f] TAG FILES...
  squaretag [-s SEP] remove [-v] [-n] [-f] TAG FILES...
  squaretag          clear  [-v] [-n] [-f] FILES...
  squaretag [-s SEP] rename [-v] [-n] [-f] OLD_TAG NEW_TAG FILES...
  squaretag [-s SEP] list FILES...
  squaretag [-s SEP] search [-I REGEX] SEARCH FILES...
  squaretag          untagged FILES...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Squaretag helps you to organize your files by tagging them. The tags
are saved in the filename by adding all tags in square brackets either
at the end of the filename or just before the last dot.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Suppose the current directory contains the following files:

  $ squaretag untagged
  picture01.jpg
  picture02

Now you want to add the tag I<family> to all pictures.

  $ squaretag add -v family *
  picture01.jpg -> picture01[family].jpg
  picture02 -> picture02[family]

Files can have multiple tags

  $ squaretag add -v myself picture01[family].jpg
  picture01[family].jpg -> picture01[family,myself].jpg

You can rename single tags

  $ squaretag rename -v myself me picture01[family,myself].jpg
  picture01[family,myself].jpg -> picture01[family,me].jpg

Or delete a tag

  $ squaretag remove me -v picture01[family,me].jpg
  picture01[family,me].jpg -> picture01[family].jpg

And what would tags be good for if you couldn't search for them

  $ squaretag search 'family && !me' *
  picture02[family]

And if you have enough, you can simple clear all tags

  $ squaretag clear *
  picture01[family].jpg -> picture01.jpg
  picture02[family] -> picture02

Tags can also have values:

  $ squaretag add read=2016 book.epub
  $ squaretag search 'read>2010' *
  books[read=2016].epub
  $ squaretag search 'read<2010' *
  $ squaretag search 'read=2016' *
  books[read=2016].epub

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item add TAG FILES...

Add TAG to FILES. TAG is a comma seperated list of tags to add. If
a tag has a suffix of I<-> this tag will be removed from the file.

=item remove TAG FILES...

Remove TAG from FILES. TAG is a comma seperated list of tags to remove. If
a tag has a suffix of I<+> this tag will be added to the file.

=item search SPEC FILES...

List all FILES that match the search SPEC. SPEC can contain tags and
the usual boolean operators.

For example:

  read && good
  !read || (not_read && prio )

There are four additional operators I<E<lt>>, I<E<gt>>, I<=> and I<~> to handle tags
with values.

=over 4

=item I<=>

Compares if operands are string-equal.

=item I<E<lt>>, I<E<gt>>

Numerical less-than or more-than comparison.

=item I<~>

Checks if left operand contains right operand as substring.

=back

=item clear FILES...

Remove all tags from FILES.

=item rename OLD_TAG NEW_TAG FILES...

Rename OLD_TAG in NEW_TAG in all FILES.

=item list FILES...

List and count all tags for FILES. The tags are sorted in descending
order of frequency.

=item untagged FILES...

List all FILES without a tag.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --verbose|-v

Print what squaretag does.

=item --dry-run|-n

Just print which files squaretag would rename without doing it.

=item --force

Ignore warnings about tags that look like files and overwriting existing
files.

=item --separator=SEP|-s=SEP

The string to separate tags. Defaults to I<,>.

=item --implicit=REGEX|-I=REGEX

Apply regex to the basename of the file without its tags. All matched
capture groups are added as tags with less precedence than the explicit
tags.

For example, if regex is '^(?<author>(.+?),' and the file is called
'Pratchett, Terry - Color of Magic.epub', a tag I<author> with the value
of I<Pratchett> is added.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

squaretag will try to read I<$HOME/.squaretagrc> on startup. Empty lines
are ignored, as is everything after I<#>. Everything else is a key-value
combination separated by a equal sign. All options can be set. Quoting
is optional, except to save trailings whitespace.

  separator = " " # by space!
  force = 1

=head1 RATIONALE

Tagging files in a way that tags are preserved cross-platform or even
cross-filesystem seems to be a hard problem with no clear cut solution.

=head2 Fileformat

Some file formats as mp3 or pdf support saving tags inside the files but there
a a lot (probably most) that don't. And even the former need special programs
to do that.

=head2 Filesystem

Many modern file systems support tags and special meta data streams, but the
tags are most likely lost when you copy files from one file system to the next.

=head2 External database

Keeping the tags in a external database requires a sync step after moving or
deleting files. This is harder than it sounds, you probably need the keep
checksums to reckognize known files after a rename.

=head2 Filename

All filesystems limit the length of the filename, so the number of tags
you can save per file is also limited. And even before you reach the
limit, the filename will be hard to read.

But at least it works for all kinds of files, it not dependent on your file or
operating sytemen is does not need external tools or syncing steps.
